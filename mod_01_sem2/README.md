## Running the module_01 assignment files as:
Problem 1: basic_functions.py 
This program helps us to understand the basic functions involved in solving different things using Python

Problem 2: hello_you,py
This function returns the name, so it lets us know the basic functions used in python programming

Problem 3: sliding_window.py
This program helps us to understand and derive kmer strings and gc content for the sequence under study

Problem 4: sliding_window_fasta.py
This program uses sliding_window function and thereby gives us kmer strings and gc content of the fasta input file 

Problem 5: hamming.py
This program helps us find the hamming distance which is one of several string metrics for measuring the edit distance between two sequences.

Problem 6: fibonacci.py
This program prints the population size at the given day.

### Running the program by the following additional data files:
Dengue.fasta
